4. WHEN processing multiple files THEN the system SHALL maintain the order of files as specified by the user

### Requirement 2: Document Organization

**User Story:** As a Kiro user, I want the generated PDF to be well-organized with a table of contents, so that I can easily navigate through the document.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. WHEN generating the PDF THEN the system SHALL set appropriate metadata (title, author)

### Requirement 4: Command-Line Interface

**User Story:** As a Kiro user, I want a simple command-line interface, so that I can easily use the tool in my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is executed THEN the system SHALL accept command-line arguments for input files and output file
2. WHEN the tool is executed THEN the system SHALL provide optional arguments for customization (TOC level, optimization, CSS)
3. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL display progress information
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display informative error messages
5. WHEN the conversion is successful THEN the system SHALL display a success message with the output file path
